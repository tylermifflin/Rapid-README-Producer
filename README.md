## Description
The purpose of this app is to help users save time by helping them rapidly create a professional README so that they can focus their time and energy on   writing code and fixing  issues. I learned a lot about using  node, inquirer, markdown templates, and including hyperlinks in markdown templates. Here is a link to my video demoing the functionality of my app: https://drive.google.com/file/d/17rxuHfYTDYamc2heJeu3Zq0QBeksTQWD/view?usp=share_link    
Here is a screenshot showing what the product looks like  after the demo test video is complete:
