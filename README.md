## Description
The purpose of this app is to help users save time by helping them rapidly create a professional README so that they can focus their time and energy   on   writing code and fixing  issues.  I  learned  a lot about using  node,inquirer,markdown templates, and including hyperlinks in markdown templates. Here is alink to my  video    demoing the functionality of my app:   https://drive.google.com/file/d/17rxuHfYTDYamc2heJeu3Zq0QBeksTQWD/view?usp=share_link    Here are  a couple screenshots showing what the product looks like  after the demo test video is complete:'/Users/tylermifflin/Desktop/Screenshot 2023-04-22 at 3.42.18 PM.png'               '/Users/tylermifflin/Desktop/Screenshot 2023-04-22 at 3.42.42 PM.png'
